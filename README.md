# tapered  [![Build Status](https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/telemachus/tapered/status.png)](https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/telemachus/tapered/latest) [![codecov.io](http://codecov.io/bitbucket/telemachus/tapered/coverage.svg?branch=master)](http://codecov.io/bitbucket/telemachus/tapered?branch=master)

## Synopsis

Very minimal tap testing for Lua. Arguably too minimal.

## Assertions

The `message` parameter is always optional. Brief messages help make test output
clearer to readers, but are not needed if the output goes straight to another
program for parsing.

+ `ok(expression, [message])` Tests whether `expression` returns a truthy
  value.

+ `nok(expression, [message])` Tests whether `expression` returns a falsy
  value.

+ `is(actual, expected, [message])` Tests whether `actual` is equal to
  `expected`. The test uses `==` internally.

+ `isnt(actual, expected, [message])` Tests whether `actual` is not equal to
  `actual`. The test uses `~=` internally.

+ `same(actual, expected, [message])` Tests whether `actual` is a deep copy
  of `expected`. The test uses an `__eq` metamethod if one is found. Useful
  for comparing tables.

+ `like(string, pattern, [message])` Tests whether `string` matches the given
  `pattern`.

+ `unlike(string, pattern, [message])` Tests whether `string` does not match
  the given `pattern`.

+ `pass([message])` A test that always passes. Useful as a quasi-skip with a
  message.

+ `fail([message])` A test that always fails. Useful as a quasi-TODO with a
  message.

+ `boom(function, args, [message])` Calls `function` with `args` as
  parameters and checks to see if an exception is raised. Passes if an
  exception is raised; fails otherwise. (The exception is swallowed.) The
  `args` parameter expects a table. The table can be empty but not `nil`.

## Helper methods

Tests will often need to set up the environment or prepare data in various ways.
In order to make this simpler, two methods are provided to precede and follow
each test.

+ `setup` Define a global method named `setup`, and it will be run before each
  test. The method itself can contain as much code as necessary to prepare for
  the following tests.

+ `teardown` Define a global method named `teardown`, and it will be run after
  each test. The method itself can contain as much code as necessary to clean up
  after each test.

Please note that `setup` and `teardown` must be defined as **global** methods
within your test file. Otherwise, they will not be called. In addition, you can
redefine either method as any time in the file to change what `setup` or
`teardown` mean at that point in execution. If you want to stop calling either
of these methods, simply redefine it as `nil`. E.g.

	local t = require 'tapered'

	setup = function ()
	  -- Start up a database. Fill it with test data. Go nuts.
	end

	-- Whatever is inside `setup` is done *before* each of the tests below.
	-- For whatever reason, we currently have no `teardown` code, so nothing
	-- is run after these three tests.
	t.is(x, y, msg)
	t.isnt(a,b, msg)
	t.same(obj1, obj2, msg)

	setup = function ()
	  -- Redefine setup for later tests.
	end

	teardown = function ()
	  -- Define a teardown method now
	end

	-- Now whatever is inside `setup` will be done before each test below;
	-- whatever is in `teardown` will be done after each test.
	t.is(p, q, msg)
	t.like(str, pattern, msg)

	setup = nil
	-- `setup` will no longer be called, but `teardown` still will.
	-- And so on...

In addition, a method is available to show how many tests were run. (This output
is required for [TAP compliance][tap], which may matter in some cases.) 

[tap]: http://testanything.org/tap-specification.html

+ `done([number])` Call this function (optionally) at the end of your test file.
  It will print out a line in the form `1..n` where `n` is the total number
  of tests run. This secures TAP compliance when needed. The call to `done`
  is not otherwise required. If you don't care about TAP compliance, neither does
  the library. If you pass the optional parameter to the method, it will check
  whether the number of tests you expected matches the number of actual tests.
  Thus, if can function like a traditional `plan` method. However, this method
  should always be called *last* in your tap file, unlike `plan` methods which
  normally start the test file.

  Another reason to use `done` is if you care about the exit status of the
  tests. Many continuous integration tools rely on tests signalling success or
  failure via their exit status. After `done` is called, the script will exit
  with a status of 0, indicating success, if all tests passed. If some tests
  failed, the script will exit with a status equal to the number of failed
  tests, indicating failure. A script will also exit with an error status if
  there is a mismatch between the actual number of tests run and the number
  passed to `done` as a parameter.

## Varia

The module provides four informational functions that return strings. They
should be self-explanatory.

## Credits

For the `same` method I took ideas and code from [Penlight][p], [Underscore][u],
[luassert][l], and [cwtest][cw]. I thank all the people who worked on those.

Indirect inspirations include [knock][k], [Test::More][tm], and [bats][b]â€”not so
much for code as for ideas about testing and simplicity.

Thanks in particular to [Pierre Chapuis][pchapuis] for help with ideas and
getting continuous integration for tapered.

All the mistakes are mine. See [version history][c] for release details.
